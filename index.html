                        I had cancer twice as a child and consequently fell behind national curriculum. I enrolled in Kumon Math and my Ma brought me books from school and local library to pour over. I got better and kept working and teaching myself in the way I had been whilst in hospital. I knew when older I wanted to give back. Medicine was a natural path but I take sadness way too much to heart and am quite sensitive on such things and also cannot rationalise the fact that I can train 100 hrs per week and still have people die in my care. I decided when around 14 to earn as much money and deploy it smartly (only years later would I hear the term Effective Altruism cited by the charity 80000hrs). I headed straight into finance after my studies having been awarded a Scholarship to intern in New York as well as trading desks in London. However, I felt quite physically and mentally sick in this period and felt a sense of degradation in character. I stopped this route, self-trained in baking sourdough breads and gained an employment offer at The Bread Factory. I found this a fun way to regain myself somewhat and decided to switch into helping the root problem which I had grown fascinated with: homelessness. I wanted to establish a body of skills/knowledge through a few years of hard graft at multiple start-ups in food/education/healthcare/finance/e-commerce and in roles spanning data analysis/operations/strategy/marketing/product/research/finance. All the while, I funded myself by tutoring.
