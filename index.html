                    <div>
                        I had cancer twice as a child and consequently fell behind national curriculum. I enrolled in Kumon Math and my Ma brought me books from school and local library to pour over. I got better and kept working and teaching myself in the way I had been whilst in hospital. I knew when older I wanted to give back. Medicine was a natural path but I take sadness way too much to heart and am quite sensitive on such things and also cannot rationalise the fact that I can train 100 hrs per week and still have people die in my care. I decided when around 14 to earn as much money and deploy it smartly (only years later would I hear the term Effective Altruism cited by the charity 80000hrs). I headed straight into finance after my studies having been awarded a Scholarship to intern in New York as well as trading desks in London. However, I felt quite physically and mentally sick in this period and felt a sense of degradation in character. I stopped this route, self-trained in baking sourdough breads and gained an employment offer at The Bread Factory. I found this a fun way to regain myself somewhat and decided to switch into helping the root problem which I had grown fascinated with: homelessness. I wanted to establish a body of skills/knowledge through a few years of hard graft at multiple start-ups in food/education/healthcare/finance/e-commerce and in roles spanning data analysis/operations/strategy/marketing/product/research/finance. All the while, I funded myself by tutoring.

                        With the experience I have gained thus far, I now need to learn software engineer skills to build my Charity. The idea is quite simple. The stats vary but circa 60% of homeless youth have mobile phones. They need to be connected to resources in food/education/healthcare/living etc. They need clear apps for this and instructions to follow (I can leverage my teaching skills for this). I am also currently doing the Udacity Python AI Nanodegree to learn about Neural Networks with intention of building models to understand behaviour patterns. I have also interviewed hundreds of homeless around London and Essex.

                        Intuitively, whilst I have no background in the homelessness sector, it strike same as an incredibly complex and convoluted one in which there are tangled webs spanning multiple needs. Something I relish in any challenge is connecting ideas from seemingly disparate bodies of knowledge. For example, I used my work at City Pantry to inform my work at Doctor (mentioned above). This sort of cross-pollination is a micro-example of what I need to build to at least begin to help make a dent in this overwhelmingly challenging sector.
